what is bolo stark ?

We all know we have a standard voice assistant for laptop --Cortona...which helps us to do various day today life tasks.
So Bolo stark is one's personal assistant which will not only target general audience but also professionals like developers,data scientists,mathematicians
and it will also help students and physically disabled people.



Slide 2

I guess we can easily recognize all the icons here and we know these are the voice assistants that are dominating the market for automating laptop

The key features that are being used mostly by users are -Make a todo list,playing music,Sending email,scheduling meeting,getting information and facts ,opening apps,
opening application and doing basic calculations


Slide 3
But all these voice assistants can't do complex tasks which is required by developers , data scientist,ml people , devops people,students,mathematician,etc.

So first we tried to cover almost all the features that you saw in the previous slide and to do the complex taks that current voice assistants are not doing..
So we came up with the following features to help all ..which are..:- (See slides and explain the basic procedure)(For password manager thing add encryption and decryption thing)



SLide 4

Major modules and technologies which we are using are -Google Speech-to-text and text-to-speech which is helping us in understanding what user said and responds according to the tasks
                                                      - Sapi which is a speech engine api developed my Microsoft is used here for BOLO stark voice
                                                       -Tkinter ha been used for the UI thing
SLide 5 
Refer slides and add according to you anything
Our main feature in future that we will be working on is pushing and pulling branches from and to git repositories.
Editing notes using voice assistant
More devops tools like ockerhub will be added for creating docker images using voice

Slide 6 
It will help developers, data scientist,mathematician, students to focus on other tasks that cannot be handled by BOLO Stark which means they will be able to focus 
on more complex things which will save time and impact business in a positive way.Moreover it will help Ml ,ai people to make algorithms..Password manager will remove the need of 
resetting your password just because you forgot it .We will be circulating text reader and notes taker for free for social cause in charity for disabled people.
Rest almost all the features have been added for user benefit(like sending email, 
searching google, playing songs, top news, info about anything. etc.)â€‹

Now its demo time
